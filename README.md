## Description*

For this assignment, we were given a starter code with a fully functioning Google Books API search engine built with a RESTful API, and were told to refactor it to be a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. The app was built using the MERN stack with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API. It's already set up to allow users to save book searches to the back end.

This application facilitates book search functionality, allowing users to browse through a comprehensive library. Once logged in, users gain the capability to save selected books for later reference. These saved books can be conveniently accessed and managed through the dedicated 'See Your Books' page, providing users with the ability to delete entries as needed.
